# hilbeRt

The goal of hilbeRt is to draw some pretty Hilbert curves.
It is inspired by the Coding Train's episode on Hilbert
curves ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSK-MW-zuAc))
and the code is largely just a port of the original
java/processing code to R.
This in turn is an implementation of
[this algorithm](https://marcin-chwedczuk.github.io/iterative-algorithm-for-drawing-hilbert-curve) by Marcin Chwedczuk.

## Installation

You can install `hilbeRt` from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jannikbuhr/hilbeRt")
```

## Example

```{r example, cache=TRUE, gganimate=list(width = 1024, height = 1024)}
library(hilbeRt)
get_hilbert_paths(1:7) %>%
  animate_hilbert_morph()
```
